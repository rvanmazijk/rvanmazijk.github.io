# Adam’s potential solutions to having TOO MUCH LITERATURE TO READ

## Read with a purpose

Why are you reading? Diff reasons have diff methods

- Reading for ideas & interest
    - consumer, not critic. This is still important!
    - Science/Nature/TREE
    - Science journalism even!
- Reading for an overview of the literature on a topic
    - Do this more (NB for Hons)
    - quick & dirty (titles, abstract only even!)
    - creating a map of the lit on your topic; get a feel for what’s out there
    - book chapters and reviews very helpful here
    - follow the ‘trail’ to find good papers
        - but what are good papers? ~ Journal, impact, author, etc.
- Reading to learn about specifics for your work
    - Do this less, but it is NB!
    - Actually reading the paper properly, only a select few papers
    - Be selective!
        - Good authors
        - Highly cited
        - Or VERY relevant
        - (_some lucky papers, some unlucky papers_)

## Organise

Reference managers!

Learn the anatomy of the scientific paper. Read in sync with that.
    - Dipping in and dipping out is FINE
    - the multiple passes of reading (Keshav, 2007):
        - 20 min; 2 hr; 9 hr

Set aside time for reading.
    - Read a 1. little a lot and a 2. lot a little.
        - = Journal alerts, GS alerts, quick n dirty, stay on top w/o much work!
        - = Time consuming!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    - DON’T TRY N READ TOO MUCH!!! YOU WILL NEVER BE FINISHED.

Reward yourself!
    - Reading is hard… you need to feel like you ARE making progress…
        - it is crucial work, reading
    - Logging your reading activities! To done lists :)
    - See your reference library grow (organically!) = satisfying
    - Journal club?
    - Journal diary!

## Final thoughts

- READING = EFFECTIVELY WRITING PRACTICE!
- BEWARE PREDATORY JOURNALS

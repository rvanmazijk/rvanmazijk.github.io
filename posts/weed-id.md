# Identifying and thinking about a weed

Living in the same city your whole life means you develop a sense of familiarity with the weeds in gardens and along roads and in fields. I suppose that is arguably conditional on your being ecologically inclined, however.

Either way, in the past three months (spring in this part of the world) I have been particularly aware of these:

These plants grow *en masse* here in the Western Cape, South Africa, as invasive weeds: basically everywhere there's space or disturbance, in usually large sprawling patches. My confusion about the identity of this weed follows.

Stumbling upon this species' identity in an illustrated book of British flora (I forget which), I made note that this was indeed *Echium vulgare*, a.k.a. viper's bugloss, or blueweed. My identification seemed to concur with my knowledge at the time: *E. vulgare* is indeed [invasive in the Western Cape](http://www.invasives.org.za/legislation/item/244-blue-echium-echium-vulgare), concurring with the droves of it I see around me; and its flowers were incredibly similar to those illustrated in the book I saw.

However, upon closer inspection, I may have misidentified it:

I am a Masters student in the Dept. of Biological Sciences at the University of Cape Town (UCT), where I happily work on all hings ecology and evolutionary biology, particularly in plants. I am lucky to work in the centre of a floristically megadiverse part of the world, the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), in the southwestern Cape of South Africa. I am most fascinated by phylogenetic systematics, plant ecophysiology, phylogenetic ecology and evolutionary biology in general.

I am also the Student Representative on the Southern African Association of Systematic Biology (SASSB), where I am working to create a more inter-connected and active community of young systematists and evolutionary biologists in southern Africa.

A short version of my CV is available as PDF [here](cv/RvanMazijk_CV_1page.pdf), and a more comprehensive one [here](cv/RvanMazijk_CV_full.pdf). You can also see the comprehensive CV in-browser [here](cv/RvanMazijk_CV_full.html).

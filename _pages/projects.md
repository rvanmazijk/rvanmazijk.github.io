## Genome-size, ecophysiology & phenology in CFR sedges {#MSc}

My MSc has me investigating the links between genome-size and ecophysiological limitations, such as water-use efficiency, in the sedge genera _Schoenus_ L. and _Tetraria_ Beauv (Cyperaceae, tribe Schoeneae)---all fynbos species in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). I'm using morphological, physiological and phenological data to ascertain how (or if) rampant polyploidisation events in the _Schoenus_ lineage affect those species' ecologies, and comparing this to the polyploid-poor _Tetraria_ species.

My supervisors are Associate Profs [Muthama Muasya](http://www.biologicalsciences.uct.ac.za/bio/staff/academic/muasya), [Tony Verboom](http://www.biologicalsciences.uct.ac.za/bio/staff/academic/verboom) and [Adam West](http://agwest.yolasite.com/). See the ResearchGate project [here](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Genome-size-water-use-ecophysiology-habitat-phenology-in-Cape-Schoenoid-sedges-Cyperaceae-Schoeneae).

## Environmental heterogeneity & plant diversity in mediterranean-type flora {#Cape-vs-SWA}

[My largest side-project](/Cape-vs-SWA/) carries on from my BSc Hons work with Associate Prof Tony Verboom and [Prof Mike Cramer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Cramer2). 

It's a macroecology project, where we aim to quantify how environmental heterogeneity relates to patterns of plant species richness and turnover in the Greater Cape Floristic Region and in the Southwest Australia Floristic Region. We compare the environmental heterogeneity in each region, how species richness and turnover interact in each region to produce the observed patterns of richness, and what different forms of environmental heterogeneity better predict richness in each region.

This is currently a publication in prep. for submission to the Journal of Biogeography. See the ResearchGate project [here](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Plant-species-richness-turnover-environmental-heterogeneity-in-the-Cape-and-SW-Australia).

## Isotopic tracing of storm water in an urban river {#isopaper}

My first (and so far only) publication was on [isotopic tracing of storm water in an urban South African river](http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v44i4.16). It's open access, so give it a read using the link!

See also the open-access repository for the data-sets and analyses [here](https://github.com/rvanmazijk/Liesbeek-River-isotopics/).

## Gloger's rule {#glogers-rule}

During my Honours year I also wrote an essay on [Gloger's ecogeographic rule](/Glogers-rule-essay/essay.pdf) that I'm fairly proud of.

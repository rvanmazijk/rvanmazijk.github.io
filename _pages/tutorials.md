## Teaching R

I have written a few tutorials about R and related tools for my colleagues in my department.

- [R tutorial](/R-tut-for-Muasya-lab/), for the Muasya Lab
- [An introduction to R Markdown](/Rmd-tut-for-West-lab/), for the West Lab. My slides, which contain the same content as the webpage, are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/rvanmazijk/an-introduction-to-r-markdown).
- [Data wrangling & manipulation in R](/data-wrangling-workshop/), a three-afternoon workshop on the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem of R-packges, focussing on [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) and [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). This workshop is due to run 1--3 July at the University of Cape Town, and is currently being prepared.

## Teaching biology

I have also given a lecture on the broad classifications of plants and animals for a short course for high school biology teachers, organised by the University of Cape Town's [Schools Development Unit](http://www.sdu.uct.ac.za/). My slides are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/rvanmazijk/biodiversity-evolution-and-taxonomy-teaching-biodiversity-short-course-for-fet-life-sciences-teachers).
